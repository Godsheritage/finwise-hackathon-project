              A credit score is a numerical representation of a person's
              creditworthiness, while a credit report details their credit
              history. Both are crucial for lenders to assess the risk of
              lending money, and individuals can use them to monitor and improve
              their financial health.

              A budget is a financial plan that helps individuals allocate their
              income towards expenses, savings, and debt repayment. It provides
              a roadmap for managing money effectively and achieving financial
              goals.

              An emergency fund serves as a financial safety net, covering
              unforeseen expenses like medical bills or car repairs. Ideally, it
              should contain three to six months' worth of living expenses to
              provide a buffer during unexpected financial challenges.
